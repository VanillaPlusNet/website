# Reporting players

{% hint style="info" %}
Player reports have been moved off of tickets and to a brand new in-game system that will be a lot smoother and quicker. With this new system, we will review player reports as often as we can to ensure that your reports are seen.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## **Reporting a player:**

Use `/report` to open up the report menu, or use `/report (player)` to directly report a player

After a report is made, staff are pinged in the Discord so that we further review the report. Video or screenshot proof is required for a report to be valid.

{% hint style="warning" %}
You **must** provide a video or screenshot link of the player breaking the rule that you are reporting them for, otherwise the report will be invalid.
{% endhint %}
