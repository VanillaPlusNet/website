# Leaderboard System

## Leaderboard rewards

* When the leaderboard resets on the 1st of every month at 4pm EST, the top 3 players will receive 5 days of [Legend Rank](broken-reference).

## How points are calculated

1. **Base Points:** Every kill begins with 100 base points
2. **Armor Bonus:** Points increase depending on the type and enchantment level of the victim's armor:
   * **Diamond Armor:** +30 points.
   * **Netherite Armor:** +50 points.
   * **Enchantments:** Additional points for enchantments like Protection  and Blast Protection, calculated as:
     * Level of Enchantment × 30 for Protection enchantments.
     * Level of Enchantment × 10 for other enchantments.

## Kill count restrictions

To maintain fairness and prevent point farming, restrictions are placed on how often you can earn points from killing the same player:

**3-Kills Rule:**

* You can only earn points from killing the same player up to three times within a 6-hour window.
* If you exceed this limit, you will receive a notification in red text, explaining that no points will be awarded for further kills on that player during the specified timeframe.

## Leaderboard update intervall

* The ingame leaderboard at spawn updates every 60 seconds.
  * When the ingame leaderboard updates, if there is a new players in 1st place it will be announced in chat.
* The leaderboard on https://vanillaplus.net/ updates every 300 seconds.

## Leaderboard reset

* The leaderboard resets on the 1st of every month at 4pm EST.
