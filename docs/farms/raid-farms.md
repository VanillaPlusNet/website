# Raid farms

## WIP

{% hint style="info" %}
## Vanilla+ Specific Changes

* Vexes are disabled and do not spawn on Vanilla+.
* There is a cooldown between raids starting of 30 seconds.
* Stacking raid farms may or may not work and are **not recommended**, in some cases having a player near the villager will make them work.
