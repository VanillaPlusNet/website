This tutorial shows how to build a 8x hopper speed item sorter by utilizing hopper minecarts, which is useful for farms such as raid farms, gold farms and any other high item drops per second farm.\

If you are having issues with your filters not working, break and replace all the Redstone comparators and Redstone torches.\

This item sorter utilizes a difference in mechanics between hoppers and hopper minecarts, in that a regular hopper only checks for items every 8 game-ticks, whereas a hopper minecart checks for items every one game-tick, hence it being named "8x".
