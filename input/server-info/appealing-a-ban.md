## Minecraft Bans

### **Ban Appeal Guidelines**

You may appeal a Minecraft ban by opening a **Punishment Appeal Ticket** in our Discord server.

**Important Notes:**

* You may only appeal your own ban. Appeals submitted on behalf of other players will not be considered.
* If you were banned by the Anti-Cheat system (ban reason: _Unfair Advantage_) and believe the ban was false, you must provide a **clip showing what you were doing leading up to the ban**. Appeals without this evidence will not be accepted.

**When submitting your appeal, please include:**

* Your **Minecraft Username**
* **Proof of the punishment** (e.g., a screenshot of your ban/mute message)
* Your **reasoning** for why the punishment is unjust
* The **Minecraft client** you were using at the time
* A clear explanation of **why your punishment should be removed** (when requested)

**Additional Rules:**

* If your ticket is closed or you receive no response, your appeal has been denied.
* Do **not** ping staff in channels, other servers, or direct messages to request updates on your appeal. Doing so may affect your case negatively.

### **Blacklist Bans Guidelines**

* You may appeal a blacklist by opening a **Punishment Appeal Ticket** in our Discord server.
* Alternatively, you may **purchase an unblacklist** directly at this link: [Purchase Unblacklist](https://www.paypal.com/ncp/payment/34Q7FWZNSFH88).
* If your unblacklist purchase is denied, you will receive a full refund.
* There is **no limit** to the number of unblacklist purchases you may make.

**Important:** We will **instantly deny** any unblacklist purchase if you were blacklisted for **CP/pedophilia** or **duping**.

{% hint style="warning" %}
After a minimum of six months, individuals may appeal their blacklist by creating an appeal ticket in [Discord](https://discord.gg/vanillaplus). This appeal must not only acknowledge past missteps but also convey genuine remorse for any harm that may have been caused. Additionally, it's crucial to provide assurances that similar behaviour will not recur in the future.
