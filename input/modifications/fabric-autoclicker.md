When using this mod, ensure you do not have mob-mode enabled, as it is bannable on our network.



This auto-clicker mod allows you to automatically click while Minecraft is minimised, so long as the "pause of minimised" setting is disabled. To disable this, hit f3+p.

Ensure you have the most recent version of the mod for the version you are using downloaded, not doing so many result in the mod not working as intended.

The majority of farms only require an interval of 13 ticks, with spamming and respect cooldown turned on.
