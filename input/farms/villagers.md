# Villagers

Villagers are significantly modified on Vanilla+.

Villagers are limited per chunk to 6 unoptimized villagers and 24 optimized villagers. Any villagers exceeding these limits may despawn after a short period of time.

You can optimize a villager by simply trading with it or by using a nametag named “Optimize” on the villager. This will not consume the nametag.

When a villager is optimized, it only improves server performance and has no other gameplay effects. Villager trade restock times are unaffected.

If you wish to un-optimize a villager, simply name it anything else. This will not consume the nametag.

## Villager Breeders

Villager breeders are slightly modified on Vanilla+ due to the 6 villager per chunk limit, causing them to not be infinitely stack-able.

It is suggested to move your villagers a chunk away from where they were originally bred, as this **sometimes** causes issues with breeders breaking.
