# Villagers

Villagers are significantly modified on Vanilla+.

Villagers on Vanilla+ are limited to 12 per chunk; any more than 12 in a chunk will despawn after a short period of time.

You can name your villagers "optimize" to disable their AI, meaning they will not move and therefore lessen the lag they add to the server. - This will not consume the nametag.\
Villagers that are named "optimize" still restock their trades.

If you wish to un-optimize your villagers, simply name them anything else. - This will not consume the nametag.

## Villager Breeders

Villager breeders are slightly modified on Vanilla+ due to the 12 villager per chunk limit, causing them to not be infinitely stack-able.

It is suggested to move your villagers a chunk away from where they were originally bred, as this **sometimes** causes issues with breeders breaking.

The borders of the farmland do not have to be glass panes, they can be any solid block.
