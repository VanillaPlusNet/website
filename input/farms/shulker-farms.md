# Shulker Farms

Shulker farms are slightly modified on Vanilla+ due to paper servers causing a few issues with Shulker behaviour.\
Due to this, designs often have to be altered to work effectively and be unbreakable.

You must use the schematic below since it's slightly altered from the tutorial, however this showcase is important to watch.

Shulker farms work through the mechanic where if a Shulker is hit by a Shulker bullet, it has a chance to duplicate itself and teleport elsewhere. The changes made to this farm manipulate those properties to create a safe chamber in the event your original Shulker accidentally dies, which has a low chance of happening but is not impossible.

In the event your main Shulker does die, simply flick the lever and your safety Shulkers will be released into the farm, replacing the original Shulker.

Once your safety Shulkers are released into the farm, ensure to flick the lever back down.
