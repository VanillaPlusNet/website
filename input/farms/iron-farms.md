# Iron Farms

Iron farms are slightly modified on Vanilla+.\
Iron farms are generally slower on Vanilla+, this is due to reduced iron golem spawning and modified spawning mechanics that are in place to optimize server performance.

For this farm, it is recommended that you put the Pillager into a boat, and then put that boat into the minecart shown in the tutorial. This way, you can get into the boat with the Pillager when AFKing the farm to boost your rates.

{% hint style="info" %}
This farm must use a Pillager, it cannot use a zombie.
