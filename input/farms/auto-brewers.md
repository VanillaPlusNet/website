# Auto-brewers

Auto-brewers are not modified on Vanilla+\
You may sometimes find that some potions are not brewed correctly, this will almost always be a result of TPS fluctuations (or you've run out of materials in your brewers).

This Autobrewer type is commonly called a "HCF Autobrewer"

These styles of Auto-brewer are by far the best in existence due to their extreme simplicity and speed.

This style of Auto-brewer is similar to the previous style, except it is changed to be a "1wt" (one wide tile-able) version, which is more effective if you need a large amount of potions.
