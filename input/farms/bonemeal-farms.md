# Bonemeal Farms

Bonemeal farms are not modified on Vanilla+

There are a plethora of automatic bonemeal farm designs, however it is recommended to **avoid designs by TheySix** since their designs are copies of genuine designs with over-exaggerated rates and difficult to follow tutorials, often resulting in farms not working.

## Ilmango Bonemeal Farm

This is by far the fastest bonemeal farm for how simple it is to build, however there are a few things to note before using the farm on Vanilla+.

* Do not run the farm over server restarts - this will break the farm. Your lava will be destroyed and your stone will be replaced by cobblestone, which cannot be turned into moss. If you end up running the farm over restart, you must replace **all** the cobblestone with normal stone and place back any destroyed lava.
* Do not leave the chunks the farm is in while the farm is on - doing so will result in the same issues as above.\
  If you build the 5 module version, it is recommended to stand in the middle under the farm to ensure the entire farm is loaded.
* Remember to place a single item in the farms clock once finished building, otherwise the farm will not start when turned on.
