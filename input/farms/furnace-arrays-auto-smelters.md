# Furnace Arrays / Auto-Smelters

Auto-smelters are slightly modified on Vanilla+ due to TPS fluctuations and reduced hopper speeds.

Due to these TPS fluctuations and reduced hopper speeds, you will notice a lot of furnaces are missed by your hopper minecart. Because of this, auto-smelters are typically around 50% as efficient on Vanilla+ as they would be a regular survival world.

## Fueling

The majority of people will use coal, blaze rods or other conventional methods to smelt their items. However, if you're smelting a bulk amount of items and do not have the fuel required for an extended smelting session, you may wish to hook a lava farm up to your smelter.

## Super-smelters

{% hint style="info" %}
Super-smelters refer to large-scale auto-smelters.

The above super-smelter is directional and must be built facing East or West according to following screenshot.

* Before using the farm, you must load 6 hopper minecarts into the glass tube with the fence gate at the bottom. You can do this simply by pushing them in from above.
* This farm is recommended to use Coal Blocks. You can load your fuel into the chest minecart that travels around the lower rail system.
* You can place sand Shulkers directly onto the hoppers that feed into the loading bay, removing the need to manually move items into chests.

## Auto-smelters

Autosmelters do not suffer from the reduced hopper speed issue at the cost of being smaller and overall slower.
