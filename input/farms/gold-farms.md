# Gold Farms

Gold farms are modified on Vanilla+ due to several reasons.

## Overworld Gold Farms

Overworld Gold farms that utilize spamming nether portals are nerfed on Vanilla+, this is due to two things. The first being the 48 block spawn radius creating the need for alternative accounts to be present in order to fully load the farms. The second being a server mechanic in which when there are a large amount of the same mob in a chunk for an extended period of time, they will despawn. This is an issue with Overworld Gold farms since the time before a Zombie Pigmen is killed is quite long.

\* note you can only build two layers of this farm if you are not using an alternative account to load extra layers.

## Magma Based Gold Farms

All magma based gold farms need to be slightly modified.\
If you are too close to mobs that are spawned through pack spawning, their AI will not work, clogging your farm and killing your rates. If you are having this issue, make your afk spot/kill chamber further away from the spawning spots. If you have a farm design that has spawn spaces above and below you, you will need to remove a few layers to fix the issue.

\* this farm quickly moves Zombie Pigmen to the overworld in order to free up the mobcap.\

## Nether Portal Spam Gold Farms

These are by far the best type of gold farm on Vanilla+, the main drawback being that they require a large amount of obsidian to make.

  It is **imperative** that you orientate your Donut Gold Farm in the correct direction before building it. This direction changes according to each individual situation. You can use the following orientation tutorial to figure out how to orientate your farm.

If your farm is not orientated correctly, it will not work.

Ignore the kill chamber and Shulker loaders, attach a [Gold Farm Auto-Crafter](../gold-farm-auto-crafter.md) to your farm instead.

It is **imperative** that the farm is chunk aligned correctly, to find out how to chunk align the farm, watch the above tutorial.\
The schematic for the farm can be found below.\
