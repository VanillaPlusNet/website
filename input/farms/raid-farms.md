# Raid Farms

Though Vanilla+ is currently running on 1.21.4, none of the changes made to Raid Farm mechanics in update 1.21 are active on Vanilla+.\
\
Raid farms are easily one of the most difficult farms to make in Minecraft. Additionally, because of the number of mobs that some raid farms are able to spawn, Vanilla+ has optimizations put in place to:\
\
A: Improve the performance of the individual mobs.\
B: Nerf the speed at which mobs can spawn.\
C: Remove some useless mobs entirely.

Due to these optimizations, little to no YouTube designs work on Vanilla+.\
Thankfully, our wonderful community has designed a few working designs.

### Why is my Stacking Raid Farm not working?

* Make sure to check **ALL** Redstone
* Check the y levels and sub-coordinates for villagers, the bottom villager should be at the sub-chunk co-ordinates `9,8`
* Change the hopper clock to have 6 items in it
* Check the ticks on all redstone repeaters are correct
* Check the spawning platform (nothing should be in the way vertically)
* Make sure you're using a NON KB sword or fire aspect
* Make sure your composters for the villagers are correct so one is higher than the other
* Make sure there's no nitwit villagers (ones with green robes)
* If you're getting the raid victory bar, ensure all villager pods are getting Redstone signals sent to them
* Ensure you have not used blocks that cannot conduct Redstone in place of solid blocks. (Glass)
* **Make sure to break all temporary blocks once you have finished building the farm**

### Common Questions

Q: My villagers despawned, why?\
\
A: Your villagers did not despawn, they were likely hjit by lightning. Ensure there is a large roof over  your villager pods or place a lightning rod away from the villagers to divert any lightning.



Q: I accidentally built my farm at the wrong sub-chunk co-ordinates, how can I fix this?\
\
A: You can't, take down the farm and rebuild it correctly.



Q: I need a storage system, where can I find one?\
\
A: [Raid Farm Auto-Crafter](../raid-farm-auto-crafter.md)
