# Raid farms

### Designing your raid farm to work on Vanilla+

Raid farms are easily one of the most difficult farms to make in Minecraft. Additionally, because of the number of mobs that some raid farms are able to spawn, Vanilla+ has optimizations put in place to:\
\
A: Improve the performance of the individual mobs.\
B: Nerf the speed at which mobs can spawn.\
C: Remove some useless mobs entirely.

### Why is my raid farm not working?

* Make sure to check **ALL** Redstone
* Check the y levels and sub-coordinates for villagers
* Check the hopper clock
* Check the general timings (redstone)
* Check the spawning platform (nothing should be in the way vertically)
* Make sure you're using a NON KB sword
* Make sure your composters for the villagers are correct so one is higher than the other
* Make sure there's no nitwit villagers (ones with green robes)
* **Make sure to break all temporary blocks once you have finished building the farm**
