Obsidian Farms are significantly modified on Vanilla+ due to Wither behaviour being changed on Vanilla+ to improve server performance.

Due to these changes, the majority of YouTube or TMC Catalogue 1.21 overworld obsidian farms do not work on Vanilla+.

## End Obsidian Farms

There are a plethora of end obsidian farm designs floating around, however this design by Dropjawed is designed with Vanilla+ mechanics in mind and is extremely compact, while avoiding any pointless extra steps.
