# Wood Farms

Tree farms are slightly modified on Vanilla+ due to TNT duping being disabled, therefore requiring a constant supply of TNT being dispensed into the farm.

The Nims Tree Farm requires a few changes to work consistently on Vanilla+.

The immediate hopper in this screenshot must have the Redstone dust that was originally on it removed as it caused the hopper to constantly lock itself.

You must add an observer clock as shown in the above screenshot to activate the droppers and dispensers that the previous Redstone dust would've. \
You can optionally add a sticky piston with a lever on as an on and off switch if the noise annoys you.

This design needs altering slightly to swap the TNT duper out for a TNT dispenser. \
The attached schematic does so for you.
